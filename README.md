# Python-Instacart-Oct2023
Cleaning and analysis of instacart orders and customer profiles using Python

Objective:
  Instacart is an online grocery storethat operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. This project was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Context:
  The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. This analysis is to inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

  Data:
    This analyis uses open-source data sets from Instacart as well as a manufactured set of customer data created for the purpose of this project.
